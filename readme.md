# Amazon Product Data Scraper

I am using the Selenium library in order to dodge bot detection systems.

The content is dumped into a .json file format and dynamically loaded onto an HTML page using JavaScript and then
is displayed on the default web browser by serving the HTML file through a local web server on port 8000.

## To do

Compare price jumps over each period a certain page is scraped.
