# Amazon Scraper

## Using Python and React

I'm scraping the data from Amazon using the Selenium library to dodge the bot detection Amazon implements
which slows down the process a bit but works well regardless.

## To do

Implement a react website that displays all the scraped data

Plot the changes in product data with each day a certain page is scraped
